# simple-bci

Simple BCI design based on off-the-shelf componenets.


## Aims

This project aims to build an open-source BCI by;

* Building an EEG on the hardware side based on basic Instrumentation Amplifiers (InAmps, such as AD620) to acquire brain-waves.
* Building a neural network that that calssify these aforementioned brain-waves into specific categories to perform specific actions.


# Current Progress

Currently the poject is in design process of the hardware. Any updates made will be uploaded into this repository.
